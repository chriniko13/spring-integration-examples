    NOTES
-------------

1) The input_file directory contains two directories (invalid_case & valid_case),
   the one contains a file with the correct filename (filename should contains the: to-process )
   in order to pass the EIP filter.
   The other one contains an invalid filename in order to not pass from the EIP filter.

2) The result_file directory contains the output file when the program runs.
